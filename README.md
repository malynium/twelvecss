# TwelveCSS

Easily style your HTML elements with convenience classes, built on TailwindCSS.

## Why should I use this?

- your class lists are easier to read
- save time, by typing less classes
- conserve mental energy - because we provide various sizing standards, and options for a11y compatible text colors on buttons, switches and checkboxes
- cross-browser consistency - we ensure features like 'focus' look the same

For example, with TwelveCSS, you can do this:

```
<button class="button-md button-blue-600">Hello World!</button>
```

Instead of Tailwind utility classes (we still love you Tailwind):

```
<button class="py-2 px-5 bg-blue-600 text-white focus:ring-2">Hello World!</button>
```
